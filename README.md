# Distil

A simple utility script in python so you can open links in google chrome reader mode

To run it you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

You need to install the script requirements by running `pip -r requirements.txt`.

You also need to enable chrome's reader mode, you can do that from [here](chrome://flags/#enable-reader-mode)

To acutally run the script you can type `python3 distil [your_link]` in a terminal and it will automatically copy a new link to your clipboard which you can paste to chrome, or if you are on linux just type `./distil [your_link]`.
